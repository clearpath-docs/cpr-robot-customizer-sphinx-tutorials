Prerequisites
==============

Before you can use the Generic Robot ROS package, there are a few prerequisites that must be met:

1. You have a robot and your robot's computer is running Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) with ROS Noetic.

.. note::

  You can install Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) and ROS Noetic on your robot's computer using `the Clearpath Robotics ISO image <https://packages.clearpathrobotics.com/stable/images/latest/noetic-focal/>`_. This ISO image specifically targets ``amd64`` Intel computers.

2. You have the physical sensors you wish to add to your robot and they are electromechanically integrated onto your robot already. The sensors you have must be on the :doc:`list of supported sensors <SupportedSensorsEnvars>`.
