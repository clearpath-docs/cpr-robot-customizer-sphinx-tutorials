Robot Customizer Tutorials
===========================

The Robot Customizer ROS package by Clearpath Robotics provides an easy-to-use interface for adding sensors to your robot in the real world or in simulation. The usage interface consists of environment variables which can be set to add sensors visually to your robot's model, as well as to enable the launching of the sensors' respective drivers.

The sensors supported in this package are commonly used by Clearpath Robotics to customize mobile robotic platforms.
